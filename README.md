# Visual Cortex App


## Description

This is a R Shiny Web App  which served as a comprehensive presentation of a neuroscience study focused on understanding the factors that trigger neuronal firing in the visual cortex. This application seamlessly integrated interactive and dynamic graphs to facilitate a user-friendly exploration of the study data. Users were provided with the flexibility to customize the appearance of graphs, allowing them to choose both the color schemes and graph types. Furthermore, the application offered the option to select the number of data sets, making it a versatile tool for studying the underlying neural processes in the visual cortex.
